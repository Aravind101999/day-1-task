Introduction:
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.


Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are:
      
                 HTTTP/1.1
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.


It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages


It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

                   HTTP/2
                   
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

It uses HPACK for data compression.

                 objects and its internal representation in javascript  
      
      
      
      
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).



An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value



objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Properties of JavaScript Object
The property names can be strings or numbers. In case the property names are numbers, they must be accessed using the “bracket notation”


Property names can also be strings with more than one space separated words. In which case, these property names must be enclosed in quotes
